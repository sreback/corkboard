With that endeavor behind me=2C we now return to our regular scheduled pro=
gramming and this week we are discussing a very special winemaker of incre=
dible depth=2C talent and modesty=2C who I am tremendously happy to see fi=
nally getting his due.  Ever since Yaacov Oryah=E2=80=99s story graced the=
se pages three years ago=2C his popularity has risen so dramatically as to=
 render the =E2=80=9Cone of Israel=E2=80=99s best kept secrets=E2=80=9D mo=
niker moot.  Given the dramatic increase both in Yaacov=E2=80=99s populari=
ty and the number of new readers since that newsletter was published=2C I=
 am including an updated version of the man=E2=80=99s history before getti=
ng into his current focus=2C wines and plans for the future.  For those fa=
miliar with the background=2C feel free to skip the next few paragraphs.

Know Thy History
Given how well I know Yaacov and his wines=2C it=E2=80=99s crazy to think=
 that I didn=E2=80=99t meet Yaacov in person until January 2014=2C during=
 the Sommelier Expo in Tel Aviv.  However=2C I have been tasting (and reco=
mmending) his wines for year=E2=80=99s prior=2C ever since 2010 when someo=
ne sent me a bottle of Asif Winery=E2=80=99s 2009 Chavlei Aretz Avant Gard=
e=2C which was the same bottle that led me to delve deeper into the man be=
hind the delicious wine.  The oddly-worded kashrut information on the bott=
le=E2=80=99s label piqued my curiosity and ultimately led me to an article=
 from 2006 in the Israeli culinary magazine =E2=80=9CWine and Gourmet=E2=
=80=9D penned by Asif=E2=80=99s Orthodox winemaker (Yaacov)=2C which calle=
d into question much of the practical halacha relating to the kashrut of w=
ine.  In the same vein as Yaacov=E2=80=99s winemaking and overall philosop=
hy of life=2C he was ahead of his times with views.  While these days his=
 opinions are much more widely disseminated (in part due to the two in-dep=
th and highly recommended books on the topic by Dr. Hayim
Soloveitchik)=2C they remain outside of mainstream accepted halachik pract=
ice.

Yaacov was born in New York and made Aliyah with his charedi parents at th=
e tender age of five where his family settled in Bnei Brak.  From a relati=
vely early age his interests diverged somewhat from the mainstream charedi=
 community he belonged to=2C joining Bnei Akiva as a teen-ager and fully b=
reaking from tradition by studying in Yeshiva HaKotel under the auspices o=
f the hesder program.  Despite being the first member of his extended fami=
ly to serve in the army=2C following his service Yaacov returned to the fo=
ld=2C got married=2C had children and=2C after spending some additional ti=
me learning in various yeshivot=2C started working in construction while s=
tudying toward an engineering degree.

While wine was always of interest to him=2C his relationship with it was p=
rimarily as an enthusiastic imbiber until 2003 when he discovered that Sor=
ek Winery was offering entry-level winemaking classes.  Taking his first c=
ourse in 2004 and leasing his first vineyard the year after=2C Yaacov quic=
kly realized that his interest was far deeper than he had imagined.  In 20=
06=2C together with a partner=2C he founded Asif Winery=2C initially inten=
ding it to be a form of n=C3=A9gociant=2C only to realize that this tradit=
ional French method of doing business in the wine industry was ill suited=
 to the Israeli business climate where procuring raw materials of sufficie=
nt quality was far more difficult than he had imagined.  It was at this po=
int that Yaacov recognized his inner desire to create wine on his own and=
=2C with Itai Lahat at his side as an advisor; Asif released its first vin=
tage of approximately 15=2C000 bottles for the 2007 vintage.  Over the yea=
rs production increased to about 20=2C000 bottles by the 2010
vintage in addition to another 10=2C000 bottles or so made for private cli=
ents under the auspices of the custom crush facility (which ironically was=
 created to provide kosher crush facilities for winemakers that couldn=E2=
=80=99t obtain kosher supervision).

Religious Rumblings
With economic realities dictating the winery=E2=80=99s move in 2008 from M=
oshav Bnei Atarot to the southern city of Arad=2C the winery=E2=80=99s foc=
us on true local desert terroir wines became another focus point for the w=
inery.  It was at this time that the winery=E2=80=99s economic difficultie=
s started. When located in Atarot=2C the winery=E2=80=99s hashgacha was un=
der the local rabbanut=2C which enabled them to sell their wines to the ko=
sher-observing public=2C which comprise the bulk of Israel=E2=80=99s wine=
 consumer market.  However=2C the rabbanut=E2=80=99s office located in Ara=
d had a rather negative view of Yaacov=E2=80=99s anti-establishment postur=
e reflected in his aforementioned article and denied the fledgling winery=
 a formal hashgacha.  By doing so=2C the rabbanut imperiled not only the w=
inery=E2=80=99s sales but also its potential competitive advantage as a ko=
sher custom crush winery=2C combining to eliminate much of its anticipated=
 revenue.  All this despite the fact that that many kashrut-keeping Jews w=
ho knew [and trusted] Yaacov happily drank his
wines irrespective of his lacking a formal hashgacha.  This somewhat ludic=
rous situation was the catalyst for the aforementioned language on Asif=E2=
=80=99s bottles that stated that the wine was prepared in accordance with=
 all applicable halachot and only by Jews.

With his life choices already clearly establishing him as a maverick=2C it=
 shouldn=E2=80=99t have surprised anyone that his wines showcased the same=
 independent tendencies=2C with Asif focusing primarily on white wines.  W=
ith rare clarity of vision=2C right off the bat Yaacov realized how approp=
riate white wines were for Israel=E2=80=99s Mediterranean terroir long bef=
ore it became our current mainstream thinking.  From his first days as a w=
inemaker Yaacov has always focused his efforts on creating wines that he w=
as intrigued by (and wanted to drink)=2C viewing them as objects of intell=
ectual curiosity in addition to a pleasure-inducing beverage regardless of=
 their perceived marketability.

Waste Not=2C Want Not
Ever since his early days learning about the winemaking process=2C Yaacov=
 struggled with the standard practice of discarding the skins from grapes=
 intended to make white wines immediately following press.  Given the high=
 value placed on the tannin=2C flavor compounds and phenolic attributes co=
ntributed by the skins during the red winemaking process=2C it seemed illo=
gical to discard so much of the grape=E2=80=99s makeup when utilizing it t=
o make white wine.  Starting with Asif=E2=80=99s first vintage in 2007=2C=
 Yaacov was already experimenting with the fermentation of white grape var=
ietals on their skins for periods far longer than the accepted few hours.=
  It wasn=E2=80=99t until he turned out a commercial version of such a win=
e for the 2010 vintage that he discovered there were others making these t=
ypes of wines and Orange Wines (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin-contact=
_wine?utm_source=3DYossie%27s+Wine+Recommendations&utm_campaign=3D27e2c219=
87-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_05_03_08_25&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_term=3D0_48e1b2a=
353-27e2c21987-11894221) were an actual wine genre with an illustri=
ous and ancient past (it was Daniel Rogov
(http://www.yossiescorkboard.com/daniel-rogov-eulogies-videos/?utm_source=
=3DYossie%27s+Wine+Recommendations&utm_campaign=3D27e2c21987-EMAIL_CAMPAIG=
N_2019_05_03_08_25&utm_medium=3Demail&utm_term=3D0_48e1b2a353-27e2c21987-11894221) who informed him of this while tasting the aforementioned=
 wine).  In those days Yaacov preferred to describe his wines as =E2=80=9C=
white wines with extended skin maceration=E2=80=9D instead of Orange Wines=
 (partially due to their lack of oxidation and the addition of sulfites)=
=2C he has come around and refers to his current crop of ten(!) 2018 Orang=
e Wines as such (more on that later).

A Maverick in the Making
While much easier to comprehend=2C another area in which Yaacov was a pion=
eer early on is the focus on harvesting a percentage of his grapes early o=
n and subsequently blending the juice with later harvested and fully ripen=
ed grapes.  This is done to combat Israel=E2=80=99s hot weather while prov=
iding his wines with the proper balance between phenolic ripeness=2C flavo=
r compounds and sufficient acidity (I am continuously surprised at winemak=
ers who don=E2=80=99t adapt this practice in some form).

Intellectual and honest wines are always sought after and appreciated by w=
ine geeks and Yaacov rapidly found favor and acceptance among Israel=E2=80=
=99s wine cognoscenti.  His wines rapidly infiltrated the wine list of Isr=
ael=E2=80=99s top [non-kosher] restaurants=2C while his white wines achie=
ved near-cult status (and represented nearly 100% of Asif=E2=80=99s produc=
tion from the 2009 vintage).  However=2C the lack of mainstream appeal (an=
d extensive oak aging) that us wine geeks find so attractive in our wines=
 is exactly the opposite of what any winery needs in order to be commercia=
lly successful and intellectual curiosity and philosophical winemaking rar=
ely translates into financial success.  The young winery rapidly found its=
elf on unstable economic terms=2C leading it to search for a white knight=
 financial backer who re-branded as Midbar after the desert terroir so cru=
cial to the identity of its wines.  Unfortunately the new owners and Yaaco=
v didn=E2=80=99t exactly see eye-to-eye on a number of fronts and Yaacov f=
ound
himself looking for a new gig that would hopefully allow him at least a ce=
rtain level of creative freedom.

A Harmonious Marriage
As he searched for a replacement mainstream gig=2C Yaacov=E2=80=99s person=
al winemaking continued unabated=2C with some of those creations reviewed=
 below.  Starting in 2014 Yaacov assumed the position of Psagot=E2=80=99s=
 chief winemaker and immediately started to make an impression=2C especial=
ly (and unsurprisingly) with respect to Psagot=E2=80=99s white wines.  Des=
pite Psagot being a large commercial winery=2C Yaacov has achieved a great=
 middle ground between the requirement to produce commercially viable wine=
s while imprinting his winemaking style and helping to further elevate Psa=
got=E2=80=99s overall quality winemaking.  Additionally=2C with an arrange=
ment similar to other winemakers at large commercial wineries=2C Yaacov is=
 able to continue his intellectual winemaking under his own label and for=
 others.  Examples of the numerous other winemakers with similar arrangeme=
nts include Ido Lewinsohn (Barkan/Lewinsohn)=2C Kobi Arbiv (Recanati/Mia L=
uce)=2C Jonathan Hajdu (Covenant/Hajdu) and Pierre Miodownick (Netofa/Nadi=
v/Bordeaux).

In addition to Psagot and his own wines discussed below=2C Yaacov spent a=
 brief stint at Ella Valley Vineyards following the departure of Lin Gold=
 (after filling in for her during her maternity leave)=2C but that stint w=
as extremely short-lived with a negligible long-term impact on that strugg=
ling winery and acts a consultant to a number of winemakers in a variety o=
f ways (including Amos and Zwebner).  However=2C as Yaacov grows productio=
n to meet his rising popularity he is cutting down on many of these consul=
ting gigs in order to focus on a cohesive strategy for his brand.

What=E2=80=99s in a Name
Over the years Yaacov has produced a potpourri of wines including an annua=
l red wine blend for the Claro (and now Brut) restaurants=2C a highly uniq=
ue varietal S=C3=A9millon from 2009 (Valley of the Hunters after the Austr=
alian Hunter Valley style Yaacov utilized)=2C two =E2=80=9CRioja-styled=E2=
=80=9D wines (Iberian Dream)=2C a delightful GSM (Grenache=2C Syrah and Mo=
urv=C3=A8dre) and one of most interesting (and delicious) kosher dessert w=
ines I have ever tasted =E2=80=93 the Old Musketeer.  His playful=2C creat=
ive and intellectual curiosity isn=E2=80=99t limited to Yaacov=E2=80=99s w=
inemaking philosophy but carry over to the name of each wine he turns out.=
  As you will see from the list below (and the explanations in the TNs)=2C=
 each wine had a hidden meaning or play on words reflecting something abou=
t the wine or its production.

Starting with the 2014 vintage=2C Yaacov started a rebranding effort=2C co=
nsolidating his wines under the current eponymous label=2C housing his ent=
ire (growing) portfolio of wines and creating the Alpha Omega label=2C whi=
ch now represents his entire line of Orange-styled wines.  The Greek equiv=
alent of =E2=80=9Cfrom A to Z=2C=E2=80=9D the name refers to Yaacov=E2=80=
=99s view that this style of winemaking yields the purest and most complet=
e expression of the grape variety while also reflecting the utilization of=
 the entire piece of fruit.  Over the years Yaacov has produced a large nu=
mber of wines=2C with the ones produced under his own name / label listed=
 in their entirety below.  As you can see=2C he has significantly ramped u=
p production starting with the 2017 vintage=2C partially to meet increasin=
g demand for his precise=2C elegant and intellectually stimulating wines.=
  Don=E2=80=99t worry =E2=80=93 they are deliciously enjoyable as well!

Word to the Wise
Wine geeks are always on the lookout for new and interesting things=2C whi=
ch is one of the many reasons Yaacov=E2=80=99s wines rapidly gained favor=
 and near-cult status among Israel=E2=80=99s wine-drinking elite (precise=
 winemaking=2C meticulous care=2C creativity and obvious talent played a b=
ig part here as well).  However=2C other than a few wines=2C they aren=E2=
=80=99t mainstream wines and can be difficult to appreciate=2C especially=
 for those weaned on fruit-forward=2C big=2C bold and alcoholic wines with=
 plenty of oak.  Given his desire to allow the fruit to lead the way and a=
 propensity to harvest early=2C maintain acidity and use oak only as and w=
hen required=2C many of the wines can be confusing to comprehend=2C gettin=
g in the way of a wine=E2=80=99s primary purpose =E2=80=93 to provide plea=
sure.  Even those who have turned the corner and love refreshing and crisp=
 whites won=E2=80=99t find what they are looking for in Orange wines=2C wh=
ose funkiness and subdued flavors provide contra to the acidity and preven=
t it from screaming across your palate (it=E2=80=99s
there in spades and necessary to balance the heft).  Other than Yaacov=E2=
=80=99s multiple Orange-styled creations=2C the kosher wine world still ha=
s limited options with only a few other options including offerings from B=
at Shlomo=2C Hajdu and Herzog.

Interestingly=2C those not yet into wines can find orange-styled wines enj=
oyable as they are neither heavily tannic like many newly-released red win=
es or overly astringent like so many of today=E2=80=99s white wines while=
 providing subdued honeyed fruit notes with sour undertones.  From Yaacov=
=E2=80=99s perspective=2C the wines are there to stimulate thought=2C conv=
ersation and wonderment while also providing pleasure.  For the most part=
=2C the wines range between 11% - 13% AbV=2C a rarity for Israeli wines an=
d nearly all of them benefit from time and quiet contemplation.  This does=
n=E2=80=99t mean they don=E2=80=99t provide immense pleasure as enjoyable=
 wines=2C but rather they are intellectual wines with a whole additional s=
ide of contemplation waiting to be discovered.  Either way=2C all the wine=
s are highly recommended and=2C like most other wines=2C will be much more=
 enjoyable with a few friends while tasting a number of them side by side=
 and comparing notes.

Personally=2C tasting through ten Orange wines from one vintage across mul=
tiple varietals (and even winemaking styles) was fascinating and doing so=
 together with Yaacov increased my pleasure=2C enjoyment and the education=
al aspect of the tasting tenfold.  Given Yaacov=E2=80=99s goal of expressi=
ng the complete essence of the varietal it would have been really cool to=
 taste the same varietal wine in both Orange-style and as a straight wine=
=2C but 40 wines would likely have been too much for him=2C especially giv=
en his duties as Psagot=E2=80=99s chief winemaker (food for thought Yaacov=
).

Fresh off the Boat
After years of reigning supreme on the =E2=80=9CIsrael Only=E2=80=9D list=
=2C a number of Yaacov=E2=80=99s wines are being imported into the US by L=
iquid Kosher and should be available soon directly from the importer.  Oth=
erwise=2C all of the wines are available in Israel directly from Yaacov (Y=
aacov.oryah@gmail.com (mailto:Yaacov.oryah@gmail.com) ).  As I hope has be=
en conveyed through this newsletter (and the tasting notes below) =E2=80=
=93 all are highly recommended (with respect to the Alpha Omega wines=2C s=
ubject to how your palate feels about the style) and are available in rela=
tively limited quantities.

The Man behind the Mission
Each of his wines speaks for themselves as a stand-alone masterpiece of pr=
ecision and creative winemaking.  However=2C despite all the ink poured un=
til now=2C one would walk away missing a significant part of the picture i=
f I wasn=E2=80=99t to briefly say a few words about the individual behind=
 the wines.  Easily one of the most understated personalities in the Israe=
li wine world=2C Yaacov projects a quiet contemplation that belies an imme=
nse intellectual curiosity that knows no bounds.  Powerfully charismatic=
=2C Yaacov is a lover of men and strongly believes in engaging with people=
 from all walks of life=2C while striving to focus on that which unites us=
 instead of what divides us.  His intellectual curiosity=2C powerful chari=
sma and tremendous humility make him one of the most enjoyable people with=
 whom to spend time.  I always feel that I=E2=80=99d rather be talking abo=
ut ten different things in addition to the wine-related topics we inevitab=
ly gravitate towards.  He is a true renaissance man and despite knowledge
across a wide-ranging array of topics=2C he is always thinking=2C explorin=
g and striving to do more=2C making his a great person to hang out with=2C=
 talk to and learn from.

The dualities of making wine for the general public at Psagot while creati=
ng contemplative and serious wines that demand your attention under his ep=
onymous label are only reconcilable in an individual as unique as he is. =
 As such=2C this newsletter represents a rare instance where knowing a bit=
 about the man is a pre-requisite to enjoying and understanding the wines.=
  I highly recommend taking the time to seek him out=2C taste his wines an=
d spend some time with Yaacov Oryah.  I have and continue to learn much fr=
om him and hope your encounters with Yaacov and his wines will lead you to=
 appreciate his talents as much as I do!

 a hint of smoke.  The medium bodied palate is still tight but with air re=

Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C Roussanne=2C 2018:  Like most of Yaacov=E2=
=80=99s 2018 Orange-styled wines=2C at this stage the wine is closed and t=
ight=2C requiring some air time to reveal the secrets beneath.  Pears=2C h=
eather=2C honeysuckle=2C warm spices and citrus notes dominate the nose to=
gether with flinty minerals.  The medium bodied palate showcases far more=
 tannin and power than the Chardonnay and S=C3=A9millon.  The wine is lean=
=2C subtle=2C and austere with incredible balance between the great acidit=
y=2C deep fruit and complexity granted by the minerals and smoky overlay.=
  Really a lovely wine whose development I am excited to follow over the y=
ears.  If this is the =E2=80=9Cessence=E2=80=9D of Roussanne=2C sign me up=
!  Drink now through 2023=2C likely longer.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C S=C3=A9millon=2C 2018:  Reflecting the vine=
yard=E2=80=99s quality and Yaacov=E2=80=99s expertise with (and love for)=
 the grape=2C this is one of my favorite Orange wines yet.  An expansive n=
ose is loaded with funky oxidized nose backing up tart green apples=2C lem=
on and orange citrus=2C slate minerals=2C brown spices and honeyed notes.=
  The medium bodied palate is slightly oily and viscous and needs plenty o=
f air to open up but once it does you are rewarded with honeyed fruit kept=
 in check with good acidity=2C elegant tannins=2C more citrus and minerals=
=2E  Delicious now=2C complexity will come with age so give this one the tim=
e is deserves and wait at least 12 months before opening and then enjoy th=
rough 2026=2C likely longer.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C Viognier=2C 2018:  Sourced from a Northern=
 vineyard located near Har Tavor=2C the wine showcases the traditional Vio=
gnier characteristics and presents as a delicious=2C approachable=2C round=
 and mouth-filling wine with lovely peach=2C apricot and other tropical fr=
uits joined by floral notes=2C warm spices and backed by great acidity.  T=
he medium bodied palate is still closed but really opened up as the wine w=
armed in the glass and after 45 minutes layers of complex flavors were rev=
ealed including roasted hazelnuts=2C smoky oak=2C brown spices and flinty=

  Drink now through 2021=2C maybe longer.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C The First Anthology (HaAsufa HaRishona)=2C=
 2018:  As alluded to by the name=2C the wine pays homage to Yaacov=E2=80=
=99s first Orange wine =E2=80=93 the 2007 Asif mentioned above (Asufa and=
 Asif share the same root in Hebrew).  Utilizing the same varietals as tha=
t initial blend =E2=80=93 Chardonnay=2C Viognier and Chenin Blanc (albeit=
 in different percentages =E2=80=93 40%=2C 40% and 20% respectively)=2C th=
e components are comprised of the varietal Alpha Omega Orange-styled wines=
 listed above.  A subdued nose has plenty of yellow sweet apple and pears=
 along with warm spice.  The medium bodied palate has plenty of sweet frui=
t=2C baked apple pie=2C flinty minerals on a background of cloves and more=
 minerals and backed by good acidity=2C elegant subtle tannins and sweet h=

nd earthy notes lingering long.  Drink now through 2023.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C Anthology of Spice (Asofat HaTavlin)=2C 201=
8:  A blend of Gewurztraminer (50%)=2C Chardonnay (40%) and Roussanne (10%=
) but=2C unlike the First Anthology=2C here the Gewurztraminer is not the=
 same one used in the Alpha Omega above but rather a different=2C wildly a=
romatic version (also made Orange-style and then blended with the other co=
mponents.  Sweet and extremely well made with Yaacov=E2=80=99s characteris=
tic precise winemaking=2C with the spicy Gew=C3=BCrztraminer notes dominat=
ing.  The expressive nose needs some air to open up but then you are rewar=
ded with heady floral notes=2C rose hips and awesome spice=2C all grounded=
 by the Orange-oxidized funk=2C minerals and a subtle smoky note that adds=
 complexity.  The medium to full-bodied palate has nicely integrated tanni=
ns and a good acidic core providing backbone to the heady spice and floral=
 notes.  Gun smoke=2C flint and some sweet fruit linger long.  Give this o=
ne the time is needs and deserves=2C whether opening now or waiting 12 mon=
ths
before enjoying through 2026.

Ya=E2=80=99acov Oryah=2C Light from Darkness (Or M=E2=80=99Ofel)=2C 2018:=
  A blend of 33% Grenache=2C 31% Cinsault=2C 24% Syrah=2C and 12% Mourv=C3=
=A8dre=2C the wine=E2=80=99s name basically means blanc de noir (Light (wi=
ne) from Darkness (grapes)).  The wine was made with no skin contact or ma=
lolactic fermentation=2C which allowed for a fresh and vibrant wine.  Harv=
ested early=2C the wine clocks in at 11.5% AbV.  Plenty of red fruit and f=
loral notes on both the nose and palate along with rich minerals=2C near-s=
weet tropical fruit with plenty of lip-smacking acidity.  With air=2C the=
 wine opens up to reveal layers of complexity along with freshly dried hay=
 and herbal notes.  Drink now through 2021.

Ya=E2=80=99acov Oryah=2C Silent Hunter (HaTzayad HaShaket)=2C 2018:  The w=
ine=E2=80=99s name alludes to Australia=E2=80=99s Hunter Valley =E2=80=93=
 home to some of the longest-lasting (and most interesting) expressions of=
 Semillon out there=2C with the silence referring to the Chenin=E2=80=99s=
 dominance in the blend (despite the lower percentage).  A blend of Semill=
on (60%) and Chenin Blanc (40%)=2C the Chenin adds significant heft (and s=
ome floral perfume) without taking away from the heather and mineral notes=
 the Semillon brings to the table.  The expressive nose is clean=2C precis=
e and elegant with near-sweet fruit balanced with saline minerals=2C gun s=
moke=2C flint and creamy citrus notes.  The medium bodied palate is loaded=
 with acid that provides perfect contra to the rich fruit=2C slate mineral=
s and lip-smacking citrus that evolves throughout the long mid-palate into=
 the long lingering finish.  I enjoyed this wine=E2=80=99s evolution over=
 seven hours and it wasn=E2=80=99t close to being done.  Highly enjoyable=
 now but with so much hidden potential ahead
of it=2C it=E2=80=99s almost criminal to open it now=2C but if you must ma=
ke sure it gets at least two hours in the decanter.  Better to wait 12-18=
 months before enjoying through 2025=2C maybe longer.  11.5% AbV.

Ya=E2=80=99acov Oryah=2C Soulmate (Ezer K=E2=80=99Negdo)=2C 2018:  the win=
e=E2=80=99s name has a dual meaning=2C reflecting how the perfect mate cre=
ates a sum greater than its part but also pays homage to Yaacov=E2=80=99s=
 wife Patricia who convinced him to use the varietal in the blend=2C which=
 resulted in this delightfully delicious wine.  A blend of Chardonnay (55%=
) and Chenin Blanc (45%)=2C the Chardonnay is sourced from a plot shared w=
ith Domaine du Castel and Vitkin.  Great viscosity=2C medium bodied with h=
ints of tropical fruit with plenty of clean minerals and warm spices galor=
e. Fresh and vibrant with clean lines and hefty fruit from the Chardonnay.=
  Red grapefruit=2C Mayer lemon and plenty of floral notes provide the ove=
r-arching notes with the minerals and acid providing the underlying backgr=
ound that carries the wine through.  Lithe and delicious=2C the wine is hi=
ghly enjoyable.  12.5% AbV.  Drink now through 2021.

2017

Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C Chenin Blanc=2C 2017:  The wine opens with=
 a near-sweet and expressive nose of heather honeysuckle dominating but al=
so sweet orange citrus notes=2C pineapple and some yellow pears.  The rich=
 nose leads your expectations toward a full and juicy near-sweet wine befo=
re the medium bodied and slightly viscous wine hits your palate.  There is=
 a complete dissonance between what the nose led you to expect and the lea=
n=2C subtle and complex palate your mouth experiences =E2=80=93 crazy expe=
rience.  That said=2C ignoring the false expectations from the nose=2C the=
 wine is round and mouth-filling with great balancing acidity and subtle f=
ruit augmented by rich flint minerals=2C saline tannin=2C roasted nuts=2C=
 black tea and bitter orange pith.  Medium to full bodied with a nice heft=
 and nuanced complexity on clean lines and superb balance.  Varietal chara=
cteristics of the Chenin are more evident after 30 minutes of air and are=
 pronounced on the mid palate and lingering finish.  11.5% AbV=2C drink no=
w
through 2023.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Eye of the Storm (Ein HaSa=E2=80=99ara)=2C 2017 [Advance=
 Tasting]:  The wine=E2=80=99s name is a nod toward to storm that was Yaac=
ov=E2=80=99s personal life for some time with grapes=2C the vineyard and w=
inemaking keeping him grounded.  Very similar to the 2016 version below=2C=
 the wine is a blend of Syrah (42%)=2C Grenache (36%)=2C Mourv=C3=A8dre (1=
1%) and Cinsault (11%).  However the 2017 saw a small percentage of new oa=
k during the 12 month barrel-aging process and showcases darker fruit that=
=2C even though seems riper is more controlled with the wine presenting cl=
ean lines=2C tight structure and well balanced between the rich dark red f=
ruit=2C good acidity and near-elegant tannins. Red plums=2C sour cherries=
 and some currents are augmented with fresh-paved road=2C graphite and roa=
sted meat=2C combined with an herbal underlay and backed by savory and gri=
pping tannins. Drink now through 2023.

Ya=E2=80=99acov Oryah=2C Light from Darkness (Or M=E2=80=99Ofel)=2C 2017:=
 In addition to the Grenache Noir=2C Cinsault=2C Syrah=2C and Mourv=C3=A8d=
re included in the 2018 blend above=2C this wine included Tempranillo as w=
ell.  The wine=E2=80=99s name is basically Hebrew for blanc de noir (Light=
 (wine) from Darkness (grapes)).  More fruit forward and approachable than=
 the 2016 below=2C the wine has lovely notes of tropical fruit=2C melon an=
d citrus with less red fruit.  A highly aromatic nose and medium bodied pa=
late are both loaded to bear with citrus galore=2C slate minerals and some=
 stone summer fruits all backed with judicious acid impeccably balanced wi=
th the rich and slightly viscous fruit and hefty dose of minerals.  11%AbV=
=2E  Drink now through 2022.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Saign=C3=A9e d=E2=80=99Orange=2C 2017:  Bled from the Alph=
a Omega Chenin Blanc above=2C the wine is 100% Chenin Blanc.  When bleedin=
g the juice of red grapes=2C the result is a Rose while bleeding the juice=
 of a white grape yielded a wine that tastes like an orange wine while pre=
senting like a white one.  Pronounced funk and the subtle viscosity of Yaa=
cov=E2=80=99s orange wines=2C the wine showcases floral and mineral notes=
 with the fruit subdued in the background.  Nicely balancing acidity and s=
picy ginger notes round out the wine and give it some welcome complexity.=
  11.5% AbV.  Drink now.

Ya=E2=80=99acov Oryah=2C Silent Hunter (HaTzayad HaShaket)=2C 2017: The wi=
ne is an unoaked blend of 60% S=C3=A9millon and 40% Chenin Blanc (the two=
 varietals that Ya=E2=80=99acov does best with) and the name is a nod to A=
ustralia=E2=80=99s Hunter Valley whose S=C3=A9millon wines have extensive=
 aging abilities (Yaacov=E2=80=99s 2009 =E2=80=9CValley of the Hunters=E2=
=80=9D was made in that style=2C as is his not-yet-released 2017 version).=
 The wine was allowed to go through full malolactic fermentation that yiel=
ded a rich and unctuous wine=2C with plenty of delicious fruit kept in che=
ck by great tempering acidity. Loads of flinty minerals are accompanied by=
 subtle tropical fruit=2C dried summer stone fruit=2C heather and honeysuc=
kle=2C along with some spice=2C pear and ginger.  Lemon zest and more citr=
us are enhance by pleasing notes of white flowers=2C lemongrass=2C all wel=
l-balanced by bracing acidity that ensures this rich and lovely wine stays=
 crisp=2C vibrant and refreshing all the way through the medium bodied pal=
ate to the long lingering and citrus-laden finish.
Really a complex wine that is worth your time and patience to open up in t=
he glass. Part of the wine was also made into a sparkling wine=2C so stay=
 tuned for some exciting sparklers coming from Ya=E2=80=99acov in a few ye=
ars. At 11% AbV=2C the wine is great all day=2C every day and while it can=
 be enjoyed mindlessly=2C denying the wine some thoughtful contemplation w=
ould be missing out on a huge part of the experience. While enjoyable now=
=2C the wine has tons of evolution ahead of it=2C so I=E2=80=99d suggest c=
ellaring a few of your bottles to enjoy over the years through 2028=2C lik=
ely longer.

Yaacov Oryah=2C SOB=2C 2017 [Advance Tasting]:  The wine is a private bot=
tling and Yaacov kept one barrel for himself.  An eccentric blend of Grena=
che (22%)=2C Petite Sirah (21%)=2C Carignan (20%)=2C Pinot Noir (19%) and=
 Syrah (18%)=2C each component was added for a specific purpose.  The wine=
 is obviously super young and needs time to come together.  At this point=
 there is plenty of ripe red fruit on both the nose and palate alongside t=
oasty oak (the wine was aged in one new 300 liter barrel and two one-year=
 old barrels) and nice earthy minerals.  The medium bodied palate is backe=
d by gripping elegant tannins=2C with good acidity keeping things lively.=
  Fruit forward and fun at this point=2C I=E2=80=99d give the wine at leas=
t a year before opening=2C after which is should cellar through 2022=2C li=
kely longer (given the uniqueness of the blend=2C I am erring on the side=
 of caution here).

Yaacov Oryah=2C The Duke Pontiff=2C 2017 [Advance Tasting]:  Another wine=
 name benefiting Yaacov=E2=80=99s playful curiosity=2C the Duke refers to=
 the Duchy of Burgundy (mailto:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Burg=
undy) which is represented by the Pinot Noir in the blend while Pontiff re=
fers to the Ch=C3=A2teauneuf-du-Pape (mailto:Ch%C3%A2teauneuf-du-Pape) app=
ellation=2C whose style of wine is emulated in this blend of Rhone and Bur=
gundy varietals (Pinot Noir (49%)=2C Syrah (21%)=2C Grenache (18%)=2C Mour=
v=C3=A8dre (6%)=2C and Cinsault (6%)).  The wine spent 12 months aging as=
 a blend on one year oak and presents with rich ripe red fruit=2C earthy m=
inerals=2C some blueberries while the oak dominates more than many of Yaac=
ov=E2=80=99s other wines.  Good acidity=2C gripping tannins give the mediu=
m to full bodied wine great structure with tart red fruit=2C a pleasing bi=
tter herbal underlay joined with rich dark chocolate=2C freshly cured toba=
cco leaf and some minty notes on the medium finish.  That said=2C the wine=
 is far from ready and the
oak will integrate over the next 12-8 months so make sure to give it the t=
ime it deserves and then enjoy through 2022.

2016

Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C 2016:  A blend of Roussanne=2C Semillon=2C=
 and Viognier which spent three weeks macerating on its skins and 12 month=
s aging in three-year old oak barrels (which were used as new oak for the=
 2014 Alpha Omega).  The rich and somewhat extracted wine has a lovely nos=
e of sweet tropical fruits including guava and pineapple alongside gobs of=
 juicy citrus notes=2C slate minerals=2C blooming white flowers=2C brown s=
pices and some caramel.  The medium bodied palate has more rich fruit with=
 plenty of citrus and sweet minerals backed by great acidity and an impecc=
ably balanced structure.  Tight and focused with precise fruit and a pleas=
ing roundness to it=2C the wine is enjoyable now and benefits from about 4=
5 minutes of air and should cellar nicely through 2024.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C Jemma=2C Brut=2C 2016:  Made exclusively fo=
r the Tel-Aviv restaurant Brut (with whom Yaacov has a close relationship)=
 and named for the eatery=E2=80=99s co-founder =E2=80=93 Jemma Naveh.  An=
 Orange-styled wine made from 100% Semillon=2C the wine needs hours and ho=
urs of air and is enjoyable every step of the way while being educational=
 as well.  With a plush medium to full-bodied palate=2C the wine showcases=
 loads of warm spices=2C roasted nuts=2C fresh-turned earth and earthy min=
eral notes under plenty of funky orange notes=2C wild mushrooms=2C smoke=
=2C candied almonds=2C smoky wood=2C and dried tropical fruit.  Spice and=
 dried nuts linger long with brilliant acidity keeping things interesting.=
  Really interesting and enjoyable wine that will pair well with a near-en=
dless array of foods.  Drink now through 2021.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Eye of the Storm (Ein HaSa=E2=80=99ara)=2C 2016:  Yaacov=
=E2=80=99s GSM has become a regular part of his portfolio and the 2016 is=
 more reminiscent of his delightful 2016 than the 2015 version.  The wine=
 spent 12 months in oak given it some pleasing smoky notes in addition to=
 the rich red fruit (which was slightly ripe for me without being sweet)=
=2C backed by gripping tannins that need time to integrate and good acidit=
y keeping the fruit well balanced while the oak remains in the background.=
  Savory notes of roasted meat=2C asphalt and leather are joined by earthy=
 minerals=2C freshly cracked black pepper=2C earthy minerals and some herb=
al notes all blend together and yield a food-friendly wine with more mains=
tream appeal that many of Yaacov=E2=80=99s other wines.  13.5% AbV. Drink=
 now through 2023.

Ya=E2=80=99acov Oryah=2C Light from Darkness (Or M=E2=80=99Ofel)=2C 2016:=
 Maintaining a reputation for quality experimentation=2C the wine=E2=80=99=
s name reflects the creating of a white wine from three Rh=C3=B4ne Valley=
 red varietals (Grenache=2C Cinsault and Mourv=C3=A8dre)=2C accomplished b=
y not allowing the juice any skin contact whatsoever (all grape juices are=
 clear =E2=80=93 the color comes from skin=2C stems and other parts). As a=
 wine geek I am always excited to taste wines made in a new or interesting=
 manner=2C many of which aren=E2=80=99t the most delicious of options and=
 I was happy to find this wine didn=E2=80=99t fit into that category =E2=
=80=93 it=E2=80=99s really a yummy wine (in addition to the coolness of ha=
ving typical red wine notes in a white wine). The nose is redolent with mu=
lberry=2C raspberry=2C red cherry along with white flowers=2C red grapefru=
it and lime with a hint of bitter green and flinty minerals. The medium to=
 full bodied palate is more robust than you=E2=80=99d expect with great ac=
idity balancing out the rich and deep fruits with plentiful lip-smacking c
itrus and savory minerals on the mid palate leading into the lingering fin=
ish where some bitter grapefruit pith leaves a tantalizing reminder of the=
 delicious treat. 11.5% AbV.  Enjoyable now through the middle of 2019.

2014
Yaacov Oryah=2C Alpha Omega=2C 2014:  A limited edition (less than 300 bot=
tles) blend of Roussanne=2C Viognier and S=C3=A9millon that was prepared l=
ike an Orange Wine and was allowed to macerate on its skins for over two m=
onths (73 days) yielding a rich=2C bold and funky wine that I found to be=
 fascinating but won=E2=80=99t be to everyone=E2=80=99s taste.  With his f=
irst attempt at Orange wine spending just two weeks on the skins=2C the Al=
pha Omega represents a quantum leap forward in this regard.  Using the bib=
lical =E2=80=9CHaKol Kol Yaacov VeHaYadayim Yedei Eisav=E2=80=9D (=E2=80=
=9Cthe voice is the voice of Yaacov=2C yet the hands are the hands of Esau=
v=E2=80=9D) wouldn=E2=80=99t be inappropriate in this case.  A rich aromat=
ic nose is redolent with rich orange and lemon=2C honeysuckle=2C candied c=
itrus peel=2C scented candles=2C a whiff of oily petrol=2C jasmine=2C lave=
nder and crazily enough =E2=80=93 subtle notes of smoked meat.  The medium=
 bodied and layered palate has a slightly oily feel to it that is backed u=
p with plenty of acidity that also keeps the rich fruit in check
and a completely unnerving tannic structure that can provide whiplash if y=
ou aren=E2=80=99t expecting it.  Ever more than the 2016=2C the dissonance=
 between nose and palate can be unnerving.  With gun smoke=2C melon=2C tar=
t green apple and more juicy citrus alongside oxidized notes=2C the wine t=
oys with your senses and reveals layers and layers of notes as time passes=
 by.  A long and lingering slightly tart and savory finish with an overlay=
 of orange blossom rounds out this incredibly different (and delicious) wi=
ne.  Made in Yaacov=E2=80=99s house without any formal hashgacha=2C the wi=
ne doesn=E2=80=99t carry any kosher symbols but like his prior wines=2C he=
 vouches for it=2C which was enough for me.  13% AbV.  Definitely a must t=
ry and still needs 1-2 hours in the decanter before it reveals all it has=
 to offer=2C the wine should continue to evolve through 2021=2C likely lon=
ger.
Yaacov Oryah=2C Eye of the Storm=2C 2014:  A blend of Grenache=2C Syrah=2C=
 Mourvedre=2C petite Sirah=2C Cinsault and Barbera that somehow really wor=
ks together=2C combining for a delicious (and smoky) experience.  While en=
joyable as a simple beverage=2C the wine really deserves some quiet contem=
plation as the layers of complex flavors and nuances are practically outra=
geous.  Give the wine the time and effort it deserves and you will be rich=
ly rewarded with loads of rich red forest fruit=2C hints of boysenberries=
 with loads of floral notes and a backbone of rich saline minerals=2C roas=
ted meat and grilled bacon.  Warm spices=2C lavender and slightly bitter h=
erbs add plenty of nuance.  Black pepper=2C graphite and some freshly turn=
ed earth show up after a while leading into a lingering finish with plenty=
 of warm spices leaving you wanting more.  Drink now through 2022.

2011

Yaacov Oryah=2C Iberian Dream=2C Reserva=2C 2011:  Named for the Spain=E2=
=80=99s ancient Aramaic name (Aspania) and using the Talmudic expression f=
or unrealistic dreams=2C the wine is a blend of Tempranillo=2C Grenache an=
d Carignan.  The only difference between this wine and the Gran Reserva re=
viewed below is the oak aging.  This wine spent 12 months in five-year-old=
 (neutral) oak (while the Gran Reserva spent three years).  Still tight wi=
th tannins that need some time to integrate=2C the wine was even more enjo=
yable the next day.  Loaded with rich deep and dark black fruit=2C earthy=
 minerals=2C dark bakers chocolate and some notes of smoky oak the full-bo=
died palate is rich=2C velvety and caressing.  Very much an old world wine=
 made from new world terroir.  Darker and more brooding than the Gran Rese=
rva=2C the wine is finally coming into its own and only requires 2-3 hours=
 at this point in order to be rewarded with great balance and structure al=
ong with a voluptuous wine that pampers.  Drink now through 2022.

Yaacov Oryah=2C Iberian Dream=2C Gran Reserva=2C 2011:  The same wine as t=
he Reserva above that spent three years in oak as opposed to one.  The ext=
ra time yielded a wine that is far more approachable and polished while re=
taining a decent aging ability.  Rich and near sweet=2C mostly black fruit=
 on both the nose and medium to full-bodied palate.  Nicely integrated yet=
 very powerful tannins hold the rich fruit together in a harmonious blend=
 with the tart cranberry=2C deep spices=2C plenty of rich chocolate=2C pun=
gent forest notes and lovely earthy minerals that are so reminiscent of tr=
ue Spanish Rioja=2C it is shocking to think that these are Israeli grapes.=
  Beg Yaacov to sell you a few bottles of this treat but be prepared for r=
ejection=2C as the quantities are so minuscule as to be non-existent.  Dri=
nk now through 2021.

2009

Yaacov Oryah=2C Valley of the Hunters=2C Semillon=2C 2009:  Intended from=
 the get-go to be released only after a few years=2C Yaacov harvested thes=
e S=C3=A9millon grapes extra early.  Ultimately the wine was released earl=
ier than intended in minute quantities with Yaacov then [re]acquiring the=
 remaining stock and cellaring it privately until he felt it was ready =E2=
=80=93 a time that has finally arrived.  Despite being completely unoaked=
=2C the 100% S=C3=A9millon wine has some oaky notes.  Named after Australi=
a=E2=80=99s Hunter Valley dubbed by Jancis Robinson to be Australia=E2=80=
=99s greatest gift to the wine world based on the outrageous S=C3=A9millon=
 it produces=2C the wine certainly serves its namesake proud.  The wine ha=
s a rich and layered nose of tart green apple=2C white summer fruits=2C re=
d grapefruit=2C sweet nectarines=2C rich Mayer lemons=2C warm spices and l=
imestone minerals.  The medium bodied palate has 11% AbV and plenty more r=
ich fruit=2C sweet honey=2C warm spices=2C saline and more minerals backed=
 up by decent acidity that has lost some
of its bite over the last few years.  I loved the wine and was happy to ha=
ve the entire bottle to myself=2C which allowed me to enjoy its evolution=
 over the many hours it keep=2C me company.  Still vibrant with great acid=
ity=2C the wine is going strong but is unlikely to evolve further=2C so I=
=E2=80=99d drink now (unless you have a lot of bottles=2C in which case I=
=E2=80=99d drink one a year until they are gone or start to notably declin=
e).

Yaacov Oryah=2C Old Musketeer=2C 2008 (8 Year): With a day job making clea=
n and well-crafted wines for Psagot=2C Yaacov Oryah expresses his well-des=
erved reputation of unconventionality in the growing portfolio of wines bo=
ttled under his eponymous label (http://www.yossiescorkboard.com/the-many-=
wines-of-yaacov-oryah/?utm_source=3DYossie%27s+Wine+Recommendations&utm_ca=
mpaign=3D27e2c21987-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_05_03_08_25&utm_medium=3Demail&utm=
_term=3D0_48e1b2a353-27e2c21987-11894221) .  While I am not yet con=
vinced of the merit behind his planned focus on orange wines=2C I certainl=
y appreciate the non-conventional winemaking method and m=C3=A9lange of wi=
nes produced.  Currently only available in Israel directly from Yaacov=2C=
 these are certainly wines well-worth seeking out and bringing back to enj=
oy.  After revamping the port-style offering from Psagot (now marketed as=
 =E2=80=9CDevine=E2=80=9D and after a serious qualitative upgrade=2C is we=
ll worth seeking out as well)=2C Yaacov serves up one of the most intrigui=
ng dessert wines I have enjoyed to date.  A limited edition of 1=2C000 bot=
tles=2C the wine is late harvested Muscat of Alexandria spent seven years=
 aging in used oak barrels before
being blended with 6% 2015 Chardonnay which provided acidity to back up th=
e rich sweetness and balanced out the oxidized notes that give the wine it=
s complexity and testify to its potential longevity.  The long-term aging=
 is intended to allow the wine to slowly mature and oxidize providing it w=
ith complex flavors while also protecting it from future deterioration due=
 to oxidization=2C thus prolonging its ageability.  Additional wines remai=
ns in barrels and Yaacov will likely bottle it in a few years as the wine=
 continues to develop in the barrels.  A lively and aromatic nose and a fu=
ll bodied and rich palate back by good acidity are both redolent of honeys=
uckle=2C blooming white flowers=2C cr=C3=A8me br=C3=BBl=C3=A9e=2C toasted=
 hazelnuts=2C white chocolate=2C candied lemons=2C a hint of white pepper=
 and expressive notes of tropical fruit all balanced by warm spices and sp=
icy oak and a long lingering sweet finish that is enhanced by great spices=
 and more developing complexity. 15.9% AbV.  Drink now through 2035=2C lik=
ely
longer

Yaacov Oryah=2C Old[er] Musketeer=2C 2008 (10 Year):  As mentioned above=
=2C Yaacov initially bottled two of the ten barrels he made of this incred=
ible wine.  In honor of the very special dinner we both attended prior to=
 KFWE London=2C Yaacov acquiesced to my request and brought with him a bar=
rel sample of the wine having aged for two additional years in the barrel.=
  Following the incredible showing of the wine=2C Yaacov has decided to do=
 a commercial barreling of the wine representing the ten-year=2C with subs=
equent bottling following once a year or every two years.  As incredible a=
s the 8-Year is=2C the 10-Year was so much better it was unbelievable=2C s=
howcasing the incredible impact oxidization can have on a wine when used p=
roperly.  There was less maple sugar and caramel on the nose while showing=
 more pronounced notes of toasted nuts=2C intense heathered flowers and wh=
ite chocolate alongside the delectable rich tropical fruits and citrus on=
 the viscous palate.  I use the words impeccable balance to
describe many of Yaacov=E2=80=99s wines but here it was simply perfect har=
mony between the rich fruit=2C musky sugar=2C savory nuts and great acidit=
y backing it all up.  Easily one of the best dessert wines of my life.  Po=
unce on this as soon as it becomes available =E2=80=93 I promise you won=
=E2=80=99t regret it.

<br>
With that endeavor behind me=2C we now return to our regular scheduled pro=
gramming and this week we are discussing a very special winemaker of incre=
dible depth=2C talent and modesty=2C who I am tremendously happy to see fi=
nally getting his due.&nbsp; Ever since Yaacov Oryah&rsquo;s story graced=
 these pages three years ago=2C his popularity has risen so dramatically a=
s to render the &ldquo;one of Israel&rsquo;s best kept secrets&rdquo; moni=
ker moot.&nbsp; Given the dramatic increase both in Yaacov&rsquo;s popular=
ity and the number of new readers since that newsletter was published=2C I=
 am including an updated version of the man&rsquo;s history before getting=
 into his current focus=2C wines and plans for the future.&nbsp; For those=
 familiar with the background=2C feel free to skip the next few paragraphs=
=2E<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Know Thy History</u></strong><br>
Given how well I know Yaacov and his wines=2C it&rsquo;s crazy to think th=
at I didn&rsquo;t meet Yaacov in person until January 2014=2C during the S=
ommelier Expo in Tel Aviv.&nbsp; However=2C I have been tasting (and recom=
mending) his wines for year&rsquo;s prior=2C ever since 2010 when someone=
 sent me a bottle of Asif Winery&rsquo;s 2009 <em>Chavlei Aretz</em> Avant=
 Garde=2C which was the same bottle that led me to delve deeper into the m=
an behind the delicious wine.&nbsp; The oddly-worded kashrut information o=
n the bottle&rsquo;s label piqued my curiosity and ultimately led me to an=
 article from 2006 in the Israeli culinary magazine &ldquo;Wine and Gourme=
t&rdquo; penned by Asif&rsquo;s Orthodox winemaker (Yaacov)=2C which calle=
d into question much of the practical <em>halacha relating to the kashrut=
 of wine</em>.&nbsp; In the same vein as Yaacov&rsquo;s winemaking and ove=
rall philosophy of life=2C he was ahead of his times with views.&nbsp; Whi=
le these days his opinions are much more widely disseminated (in part due=
 to the two in-depth and highly recommended books on the topic by <em>Dr.=
 Hayim Soloveitchik</em>)=2C they remain outside of mainstream accepted ha=
lachik practice.<br>
<br>
Yaacov was born in New York and made <em>Aliyah </em>with his <em>charedi=
 </em>parents at the tender age of five where his family settled in <em>Bn=
ei Brak</em>.&nbsp; From a relatively early age his interests diverged som=
ewhat from the mainstream <em>charedi </em>community he belonged to=2C joi=
ning <em>Bnei Akiva </em>as a teen-ager and fully breaking from tradition=
 by studying in <em>Yeshiva HaKotel </em>under the auspices of the <em>hes=
der </em>program. &nbsp;Despite being the first member of his extended fam=
ily to serve in the army=2C following his service Yaacov returned to the f=
old=2C got married=2C had children and=2C after spending some additional t=
ime learning in various <em>yeshivot</em>=2C started working in constructi=
on while studying toward an engineering degree.<br>

ay: inline;margin-bottom: 10px;" width=3D"350">While wine was always of in=
terest to him=2C his relationship with it was primarily as an enthusiastic=
 imbiber until 2003 when he discovered that Sorek Winery was offering entr=
y-level winemaking classes.&nbsp; Taking his first course in 2004 and leas=
ing his first vineyard the year after=2C Yaacov quickly realized that his=
 interest was far deeper than he had imagined.&nbsp; In 2006=2C together w=
ith a partner=2C he founded Asif Winery=2C initially intending it to be a=
 form of <em>n&eacute;gociant</em><em>=2C</em> only to realize that this t=
raditional French method of doing business in the wine industry was ill su=
ited to the Israeli business climate where procuring raw materials of suff=
icient quality was far more difficult than he had imagined.&nbsp; It was a=
t this point that Yaacov recognized his inner desire to create wine on his=
 own and=2C with Itai Lahat at his side as an advisor; Asif released its f=
irst vintage of approximately 15=2C000 bottles for the 2007 vintage.&nbsp;=
 Over the years production increased to about 20=2C000 bottles by the 2010=
 vintage in addition to another 10=2C000 bottles or so made for private cl=
ients under the auspices of the custom crush facility (which ironically wa=
s created to provide kosher crush facilities for winemakers that couldn&rs=
quo;t obtain kosher supervision).<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Religious Rumblings</u></strong><br>
With economic realities dictating the winery&rsquo;s move in 2008 from <em=
>Moshav Bnei Atarot </em>to the southern city of <em>Arad</em>=2C the wine=
ry&rsquo;s focus on true local desert terroir wines became another focus p=
oint for the winery.&nbsp; It was at this time that the winery&rsquo;s eco=
nomic difficulties started. When located in Atarot=2C the winery&rsquo;s <=
em>hashgacha </em>was under the local <em>rabbanut=2C </em>which enabled t=
hem to sell their wines to the kosher-observing public=2C which comprise t=
he bulk of Israel&rsquo;s wine consumer market.&nbsp; However=2C the <em>r=
abbanut</em><em>&rsquo;s</em> office located in Arad had a rather negative=
 view of Yaacov&rsquo;s anti-establishment posture reflected in his aforem=
entioned article and denied the fledgling winery a formal <em>hashgacha.&n=
bsp; By doing so=2C the rabbanut imperiled </em>not only the winery&rsquo;=
s sales but also its potential competitive advantage as a kosher custom cr=
ush winery=2C combining to eliminate much of its anticipated revenue.&nbsp=
; All this despite the fact that that many <em>kashrut</em>-keeping Jews w=
ho knew [and trusted] Yaacov happily drank his wines irrespective of his=
 lacking a formal <em>hashgacha</em>.&nbsp; This somewhat ludicrous situat=
ion was the catalyst for the aforementioned language on Asif&rsquo;s bottl=
es that stated that the wine was prepared in accordance with all applicabl=
e <em>halachot </em>and only by Jews.<br>
<br>
With his life choices already clearly establishing him as a maverick=2C it=
 shouldn&rsquo;t have surprised anyone that his wines showcased the same i=
ndependent tendencies=2C with Asif focusing primarily on white wines.&nbsp=
; With rare clarity of vision=2C right off the bat Yaacov realized how app=
ropriate white wines were for Israel&rsquo;s Mediterranean terroir long be=
fore it became our current mainstream thinking.&nbsp; From his first days=
 as a winemaker Yaacov has always focused his efforts on creating wines th=
at he was intrigued by (and wanted to drink)=2C viewing them as objects of=
 intellectual curiosity in addition to a pleasure-inducing beverage regard=
less of their perceived marketability.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Waste Not=2C Want Not</u></strong><br>
Ever since his early days learning about the winemaking process=2C Yaacov=
 struggled with the standard practice of discarding the skins from grapes=
 intended to make white wines immediately following press.&nbsp; Given the=
 high value placed on the tannin=2C flavor compounds and phenolic attribut=
es contributed by the skins during the red winemaking process=2C it seemed=
 illogical to discard so much of the grape&rsquo;s makeup when utilizing i=
t to make white wine.&nbsp; Starting with Asif&rsquo;s first vintage in 20=
07=2C Yaacov was already experimenting with the fermentation of white grap=
e varietals on their skins for periods far longer than the accepted few ho=
urs.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t until he turned out a commercial version of suc=
h a wine for the 2010 vintage that he discovered there were others making=
 these types of wines and <a href=3D"https://yossiescorkboard.us10.list-ma=

erline;">Orange Wines</a> were an actual wine genre with an illustrious an=
d ancient past (it was <a href=3D"https://yossiescorkboard.us10.list-manag=
e.com/track/click?u=3D4a8a53ce144d5f045511bf809&id=3Daff5e99eb4&e=3D560aece2e5" style=3D"color: #990000;font-weight: normal;text-decoration: underl=
ine;">Daniel Rogov</a> who informed him of this while tasting the aforemen=
tioned wine). &nbsp;In those days Yaacov preferred to describe his wines a=
s &ldquo;white wines with extended skin maceration&rdquo; instead of Orang=
e Wines (partially due to their lack of oxidation and the addition of sulf=
ites)=2C he has come around and refers to his current crop of ten(!) 2018=
 Orange Wines as such (more on that later).<br>
<br>
<strong><u>A Maverick in the Making</u></strong><br>
While much easier to comprehend=2C another area in which Yaacov was a pion=
eer early on is the focus on harvesting a percentage of his grapes early o=
n and subsequently blending the juice with later harvested and fully ripen=
ed grapes.&nbsp; This is done to combat Israel&rsquo;s hot weather while p=
roviding his wines with the proper balance between phenolic ripeness=2C fl=
avor compounds and sufficient acidity (I am continuously surprised at wine=
makers who don&rsquo;t adapt this practice in some form).<br>
<br>
Intellectual and honest wines are always sought after and appreciated by w=
ine geeks and Yaacov rapidly found favor and acceptance among Israel&rsquo=
;s wine cognoscenti.&nbsp; His wines rapidly infiltrated the wine list of=
 Israel&rsquo;s top [non-kosher] restaurants=2C while his white wines ach=
ieved near-cult status (and represented nearly 100% of Asif&rsquo;s produc=
tion from the 2009 vintage).&nbsp; However=2C the lack of mainstream appea=
l (and extensive oak aging) that us wine geeks find so attractive in our w=
ines is exactly the opposite of what any winery needs in order to be comme=
rcially successful and intellectual curiosity and philosophical winemaking=
 rarely translates into financial success.&nbsp; The young winery rapidly=
 found itself on unstable economic terms=2C leading it to search for a whi=
te knight financial backer who re-branded as Midbar after the desert terro=
ir so crucial to the identity of its wines.&nbsp; Unfortunately the new ow=
ners and Yaacov didn&rsquo;t exactly see eye-to-eye on a number of fronts=
 and Yaacov found himself looking for a new gig that would hopefully allow=
 him at least a certain level of creative freedom.<br>

ent mainstream gig=2C Yaacov&rsquo;s personal winemaking continued unabate=
d=2C with some of those creations reviewed below.&nbsp; Starting in 2014 Y=
aacov assumed the position of Psagot&rsquo;s chief winemaker and immediate=
ly started to make an impression=2C especially (and unsurprisingly) with r=
espect to Psagot&rsquo;s white wines.&nbsp; Despite Psagot being a large c=
ommercial winery=2C Yaacov has achieved a great middle ground between the=
 requirement to produce commercially viable wines while imprinting his win=
emaking style and helping to further elevate Psagot&rsquo;s overall qualit=
y winemaking.&nbsp; Additionally=2C with an arrangement similar to other w=
inemakers at large commercial wineries=2C Yaacov is able to continue his i=
ntellectual winemaking under his own label and for others.&nbsp; Examples=
 of the numerous other winemakers with similar arrangements include Ido Le=
winsohn (Barkan/Lewinsohn)=2C Kobi Arbiv (Recanati/Mia Luce)=2C Jonathan H=
ajdu (Covenant/Hajdu) and Pierre Miodownick (Netofa/Nadiv/Bordeaux).<br>
<br>
In addition to Psagot and his own wines discussed below=2C Yaacov spent a=
 brief stint at Ella Valley Vineyards following the departure of Lin Gold=
 (after filling in for her during her maternity leave)=2C but that stint w=
as extremely short-lived with a negligible long-term impact on that strugg=
ling winery and acts a consultant to a number of winemakers in a variety o=
f ways (including Amos and Zwebner).&nbsp; However=2C as Yaacov grows prod=
uction to meet his rising popularity he is cutting down on many of these c=
onsulting gigs in order to focus on a cohesive strategy for his brand.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>What&rsquo;s in a Name</u></strong><br>
Over the years Yaacov has produced a potpourri of wines including an annua=
l red wine blend for the Claro (and now Brut) restaurants=2C a highly uniq=
ue varietal S&eacute;millon from 2009 (Valley of the Hunters after the Aus=
tralian Hunter Valley style Yaacov utilized)=2C two &ldquo;Rioja-styled&rd=
quo; wines (Iberian Dream)=2C a delightful GSM (Grenache=2C Syrah and Mour=
v&egrave;dre) and one of most interesting (and delicious) kosher dessert w=
ines I have ever tasted &ndash; the Old Musketeer.&nbsp; His playful=2C cr=
eative and intellectual curiosity isn&rsquo;t limited to Yaacov&rsquo;s wi=
nemaking philosophy but carry over to the name of each wine he turns out.&=
nbsp; As you will see from the list below (and the explanations in the TNs=
)=2C each wine had a hidden meaning or play on words reflecting something=
 about the wine or its production.<br>
<br>
Starting with the 2014 vintage=2C Yaacov started a rebranding effort=2C co=
nsolidating his wines under the current eponymous label=2C housing his ent=
ire (growing) portfolio of wines and creating the Alpha Omega label=2C whi=
ch now represents his entire line of Orange-styled wines.&nbsp; The Greek=
 equivalent of &ldquo;from A to Z=2C&rdquo; the name refers to Yaacov&rsqu=
o;s view that this style of winemaking yields the purest and most complete=
 expression of the grape variety while also reflecting the utilization of=
 the entire piece of fruit.&nbsp; Over the years Yaacov has produced a lar=
ge number of wines=2C with the ones produced under his own name / label li=
sted in their entirety below.&nbsp; As you can see=2C he has significantly=
 ramped up production starting with the 2017 vintage=2C partially to meet=
 increasing demand for his precise=2C elegant and intellectually stimulati=
ng wines.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; they are deliciously enjoyable a=
s well!

<strong><u>Word to the Wise</u></strong><br>
Wine geeks are always on the lookout for new and interesting things=2C whi=
ch is one of the many reasons Yaacov&rsquo;s wines rapidly gained favor an=
d near-cult status among Israel&rsquo;s wine-drinking elite (precise winem=
aking=2C meticulous care=2C creativity and obvious talent played a big par=
t here as well).&nbsp; However=2C other than a few wines=2C they aren&rsqu=
o;t mainstream wines and can be difficult to appreciate=2C especially for=
 those weaned on fruit-forward=2C big=2C bold and alcoholic wines with ple=
nty of oak.&nbsp; Given his desire to allow the fruit to lead the way and=
 a propensity to harvest early=2C maintain acidity and use oak only as and=
 when required=2C many of the wines can be confusing to comprehend=2C gett=
ing in the way of a wine&rsquo;s primary purpose &ndash; to provide pleasu=
re.&nbsp; Even those who have turned the corner and love refreshing and cr=
isp whites won&rsquo;t find what they are looking for in Orange wines=2C w=
hose funkiness and subdued flavors provide contra to the acidity and preve=
nt it from screaming across your palate (it&rsquo;s there in spades and ne=
cessary to balance the heft).&nbsp; Other than Yaacov&rsquo;s multiple Ora=
nge-styled creations=2C the kosher wine world still has limited options wi=
th only a few other options including offerings from Bat Shlomo=2C Hajdu a=
nd Herzog.<br>
<br>
Interestingly=2C those not yet into wines can find orange-styled wines enj=
oyable as they are neither heavily tannic like many newly-released red win=
es or overly astringent like so many of today&rsquo;s white wines while pr=
oviding subdued honeyed fruit notes with sour undertones.&nbsp; From Yaaco=
v&rsquo;s perspective=2C the wines are there to stimulate thought=2C conve=
rsation and wonderment while also providing pleasure.&nbsp; For the most p=
art=2C the wines range between 11% - 13% AbV=2C a rarity for Israeli wines=
 and nearly all of them benefit from time and quiet contemplation.&nbsp; T=
his doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t provide immense pleasure as enjoya=
ble wines=2C but rather they are intellectual wines with a whole additiona=
l side of contemplation waiting to be discovered.&nbsp; Either way=2C all=
 the wines are highly recommended and=2C like most other wines=2C will be=
 much more enjoyable with a few friends while tasting a number of them sid=
e by side and comparing notes.<br>
<br>
Personally=2C tasting through ten Orange wines from one vintage across mul=
tiple varietals (and even winemaking styles) was fascinating and doing so=
 together with Yaacov increased my pleasure=2C enjoyment and the education=
al aspect of the tasting tenfold.&nbsp; Given Yaacov&rsquo;s goal of expre=
ssing the complete essence of the varietal it would have been really cool=
 to taste the same varietal wine in both Orange-style and as a straight wi=
ne=2C but 40 wines would likely have been too much for him=2C especially g=
iven his duties as Psagot&rsquo;s chief winemaker (food for thought Yaacov=
).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Fresh off the Boat</u></strong><br>
After years of reigning supreme on the &ldquo;Israel Only&rdquo; list=2C a=
 number of Yaacov&rsquo;s wines are being imported into the US by Liquid K=
osher and should be available soon directly from the importer.&nbsp; Other=
wise=2C all of the wines are available in Israel directly from Yaacov (<a=
 href=3D"mailto:Yaacov.oryah@gmail.com" style=3D"color: #990000;font-weigh=
t: normal;text-decoration: underline;">Yaacov.oryah@gmail.com</a>).&nbsp;=
 As I hope has been conveyed through this newsletter (and the tasting note=
s below) &ndash; all are highly recommended (with respect to the Alpha Ome=
ga wines=2C subject to how your palate feels about the style) and are avai=
lable in relatively limited quantities.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>The Man behind the Mission</u></strong><br>
Each of his wines speaks for themselves as a stand-alone masterpiece of pr=
ecision and creative winemaking.&nbsp; However=2C despite all the ink pour=
ed until now=2C one would walk away missing a significant part of the pict=
ure if I wasn&rsquo;t to briefly say a few words about the individual behi=
nd the wines.&nbsp; Easily one of the most understated personalities in th=
e Israeli wine world=2C Yaacov projects a quiet contemplation that belies=
 an immense intellectual curiosity that knows no bounds.&nbsp; Powerfully=
 charismatic=2C Yaacov is a lover of men and strongly believes in engaging=
 with people from all walks of life=2C while striving to focus on that whi=
ch unites us instead of what divides us.&nbsp; His intellectual curiosity=
=2C powerful charisma and tremendous humility make him one of the most enj=
oyable people with whom to spend time.&nbsp; I always feel that I&rsquo;d=
 rather be talking about ten different things in addition to the wine-rela=
ted topics we inevitably gravitate towards.&nbsp; He is a true renaissance=
 man and despite knowledge across a wide-ranging array of topics=2C he is=
 always thinking=2C exploring and striving to do more=2C making his a grea=
t person to hang out with=2C talk to and learn from.<br>
<br>
The dualities of making wine for the general public at Psagot while creati=
ng contemplative and serious wines that demand your attention under his ep=
onymous label are only reconcilable in an individual as unique as he is.&n=
bsp; As such=2C this newsletter represents a rare instance where knowing a=
 bit about the man is a pre-requisite to enjoying and understanding the wi=
nes.&nbsp; I highly recommend taking the time to seek him out=2C taste his=
 wines and spend some time with Yaacov Oryah.&nbsp; I have and continue to=
 learn much from him and hope your encounters with Yaacov and his wines wi=
ll lead you to appreciate his talents as much as I do!<br>

 before being blended with 6% 2015 Chardonnay which provided acidity to ba=
ck up the rich sweetness and balanced out the oxidized notes that give the=
 wine its complexity and testify to its potential longevity.&nbsp; The lon=
g-term aging is intended to allow the wine to slowly mature and oxidize pr=
oviding it with complex flavors while also protecting it from future deter=
ioration due to oxidization=2C thus prolonging its ageability. &nbsp;Addit=
ional wines remains in barrels and Yaacov will likely bottle it in a few y=
ears as the wine continues to develop in the barrels.&nbsp; A lively and a=
romatic nose and a full bodied and rich palate back by good acidity are bo=
th redolent of honeysuckle=2C blooming white flowers=2C cr&egrave;me br&uc=
irc;l&eacute;e=2C toasted hazelnuts=2C white chocolate=2C candied lemons=
=2C a hint of white pepper and expressive notes of tropical fruit all bala=
nced by warm spices and spicy oak and a long lingering sweet finish that i=
s enhanced by great spices and more developing complexity. 15.9% AbV.&nbsp=
; Drink now through 2035=2C likely longer<br>

<u>Yaacov Oryah=2C Old[er] Musketeer=2C 2008 (10 Year)</u>: &nbsp;As ment=
ioned above=2C Yaacov initially bottled two of the ten barrels he made of=
 this incredible wine.&nbsp; In honor of the very special dinner we both a=
ttended prior to KFWE London=2C Yaacov acquiesced to my request and brough=
t with him a barrel sample of the wine having aged for two additional year=
s in the barrel.&nbsp; Following the incredible showing of the wine=2C Yaa=
cov has decided to do a commercial barreling of the wine representing the=
 ten-year=2C with subsequent bottling following once a year or every two y=
ears.&nbsp; As incredible as the 8-Year is=2C the 10-Year was so much bett=
er it was unbelievable=2C showcasing the incredible impact oxidization can=
 have on a wine when used properly.&nbsp; There was less maple sugar and c=
aramel on the nose while showing more pronounced notes of toasted nuts=2C=
 intense heathered flowers and white chocolate alongside the delectable ri=
ch tropical fruits and citrus on the viscous palate.&nbsp; I use the words=
 impeccable balance to describe many of Yaacov&rsquo;s wines but here it w=
as simply perfect harmony between the rich fruit=2C musky sugar=2C savory=
 nuts and great acidity backing it all up.&nbsp; Easily one of the best de=
ssert wines of my life.&nbsp; Pounce on this as soon as it becomes availab=
le &ndash; I promise you won&rsquo;t regret it.</div>
